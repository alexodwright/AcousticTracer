\section*{Project Proposal}
Initial idea is to trace sound waves from a sound source placed inside an environment, and to observe how the sound travels through the space and interacts with the environments surfaces.

Be able to place an observer inside the environment, constructed with an \texttt{.obj} file. Which later can be retrieved from using the LiDar scanner on a mobile device.
\subsection*{Desired Features}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ML Material Classification
        \item Observer Sound Intensity
        \item Optimal Sound Source Location
        \item 3D Scene Renderer
        \item Acoustic Rasterizer
    \end{itemize}
